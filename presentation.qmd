*\*Note: Stationarity is determined by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test at a thresold of 0.1. All non-stataionary variables are converted to a stationary form by taking the log-log difference, with the exception of Services-Only YoY% CPI.*

## Parsimonious Model: Specifications


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Predicted variable: Total CPI YoY% change**

- Total CPI YoY% Change was chosen due to it's stationary properties. 
- More prone to instability due to external shocks (eg; oil prices), unlike CPI-Trim
- Given the current economic and political instability in the United States, this might be a good thing. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Number of lags:**

- AIC criterion suggested 23 lags, however a 12-lag model was chosen to encapsulate the fact that macroeconomic policies and events can take around a year to affect the economy. 
- While more lags could be used, there was a risk of overfitting the model.

## Parsimonious Model: Specifications

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Unemployment rate and GDP change highly collinear: phillips curve
- **Break-even inflation rate:**
    + Bank of Canada estimates that 65% of consumers are backwards-looking while 35% of consumers are forwards-looking. 
    + Take difference in monthly conventional bond yields (CBY) and monthly real return bond yields (RBY) to measure consumer expectations.
    + RBY is inflation-protected, CBY is not. Difference gives us the *expected inflation rate*.

- Supply-side inflationary pressures: 
    + LFS-micro: measure of canadian wage growth
    + BCPI: measure of underlying price of raw materials

## Parsimonious Model: Measuring Tarrif Pressures

- In 2022, exports to the United States accounted for 17.8% of Canada's GDP and supported over 2.4 million jobs in Canada.
- Need a method of measuring the effect of US tarrifs on the economy. 
    + **Exchange rate**: greater tarrifs &rarr; depreciation of canadian dollar &rarr; inflation, slower GDP growth.
- Issue: Exchange rate measures broad-based, currency-driven inflation
    + **Effective tarrif rate**: US Import charges / US customs value
    + Better measure of direct supply-side shocks 

![](tarrif_rate.png){width="100%"}

## Parsimonious Models: Inflation Prediction Results

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Both the GDP-based parsimonious model and the Unemployment Rate-based model predict roughly equivalent trends in YoY %-change CPI. 

- The inflation rate is expected to appreciate slowly over the course of 2025 and into 2026, going from 1.75% in July of 2025 to 3% in early 2027. 

- The nature of a VAR-based model is high confidence intervals in predictions, so the results of the parsimonious models may be undershooting or overshooting the true inflation rate.

## Structural VARs: Measuring Potentional Effects of US Tarrifs

Given the uncertainty surrounding tariff threats from the United States, it's important we forecast the potential shocks to inflation if the tariff rate were to increase. 

- We apply a **Structural Vector Autoregressive Model:** we make assumptions about how the economy works contemporaneously, and apply those assumptions to our model. 
  + Done VIA Cholesky ordering: order variables from slowest-moving to fastest-moving.

| Order | Variables |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Exogenous Policy Shock** | Change in Tarrif Rate |
| **2. Slow-Moving Real Variables** |GDP, Unemployment, LFS Micro |
| **3. Faster-Moving Price Variables**  | CPI, FCPI |
| **4. Very Fast-Moving Financials** | Exchange rate, Break-Even inflation rate |

## Deconstructed Model: Model Specifications 

- Different variables affect different parts of CPI in different ways and to different extents.
- We can't add too many variables to our model in fear of multicollinearity and overfitting.
  + Take GDP growth and the unemployment rate, for instance. Can't include both!
- We can instead **deconstruct CPI into multiple variables, and apply different VAR specifications for each one.** Then, we can reassemble the predictions to get a (more accurate) estimate of future inflation.
  + Hedge Funds do this for hundreds of CPI baskets, but we only focus on two: **Services-based CPI** and **Goods-based CPI**.

## Deconstructed VAR: Model specifications, New Variables

### Goods-Based CPI-change VAR

Predicted variable is the goods-only portion of CPI-Total. 

- **Change in GDP**: Strong increases in GDP typically signal robust consumer spending and high demand for goods

- **Break-Even Inflation Rate**: Inflation expectations

- **Tarrif Rate, Exchange rate**: a higher tariff rate and a weaker Canadian dollar directly increase the cost of imported goods. 

- **FCPI**: Captures changes in the prices of raw materials which have a direct downstream effect on the price of consumer goods.

- **Supply Chain Pressure Index**: Measure of distruptions in the global production and transportation of goods (shortages, bottlenecks).

### Services-Based CPI-change VAR

Predicted variable is the services-only portion of CPI-Total. 

- **Unemployment rate**: Measure of labor market slack.

- **Break-Even Inflation Rate**: Inflation expectations

- **LFS-Micro**: stable signal of labor cost pressures

- **C11 Housing market price index**: Housing prices are an imcreasingly significant component of the Canadian economy. Housing is considered a service by the BOC. 

## Goods-based VAR: Results, Impulse Response Functions


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Log-% change in GDP is expected to appreciate considerably over the course of the next year and a half, reaching 2.60% in early 2027. 
- Tarrif shocks appear to have no long-term affects on GDP growth, however there is a temporary, statistically significant inflationary shock to %-change Goods CPI in the medium term, peaking at 2.1% 10 months out.

## Supply-based VAR: Results, Impulse Response Functions


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- The services-based inflation rate is predicted to depreciate considerably over the course of the next year and a half, falling from 3.0% in June 2025 to 2.2% in early 2027. 
- Tarrif shocks have a statistically insignificant effect on the services-based inflation rate.

## Housing is a Key Driver of Changes in Supply-based CPI

Another interesting result with the Goods/Services split is that housing is a statistically significant driver of changes in the Services-Based inflation rate:

![](housing.png)

## Putting it all together: Reconstructed VAR model

We can take the resulting predicted values for the goods-based inflation rate and the services-based inflation rate and recombine them using the BOC's basket weights to form a comprehensive measure of the overall inflation rate. 

![](cpi_reconstructed_forecast.png)

The results match what we predicted initally with our parsimonious model, slowly rising over the next year and a half, peaking in early 2027 at 3.25 percent.


## Review and Policy Reccomendations

- The inflation rate is expected to slowly appreciate over the course of the next 18 months reaching between 3% to 3.25% in early 2027. 

- The services sector has been very resilient to tariff threats, but consumers should expect significant increases in the price of goods should tariffs continue. 

- Housing prices have been a key driver of depreciation in the services-based inflation rate. Hence, consumers should could expect inflation to vary significantly depending on the housing market in their specific region.

- For consumers, expect strong appreciation in the rate of goods-based inflation, and strong depreciation in the rate of services-based inflation.

- Maintain the current policy rate until 2025 Q3.

- If the United States raises/maintains tariffs on Canadian exports, **raise the policy rate by 50 to 150 bp** depending on the tariff level.

- If tariffs are weakened, maintain the current policy rate, or consider a decrease of approx. 50 bp to the policy rate. 

## Limitations

- Our tariff analysis only accounts for direct tariffs onto Canadian goods and do not account for retalitory tariffs on the United States. Retalitory tariffs would result in a decrease in imported American goods and less competition for Canadian manufacturers, hence resulting in a higher inflation rates.

- **Services-based CPI is non-stationary** (albeit, close to being stationary). May result in innacurate model results.

- High confidence intervals across the board, exact future inflation remains unclear.

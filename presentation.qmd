*\*Note: Stationarity is determined by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test at a thresold of 0.1. All non-stataionary variables are converted to a stationary form by taking the log-log difference, with the exception of Services-Only YoY% CPI.*

## Parsimonious Model: Specifications


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Predicted variable: Total CPI YoY% Change**

- Total CPI YoY% Change was chosen due to it's stationary properties. 
- More prone to instability due to external shocks (eg; oil prices), unlike CPI-Trim
- Given the current economic and political instability in the United States, this might be a good thing. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Number of Lags:**

- AIC criterion suggested 23 lags, however a 12-lag model was chosen to encapsulate the fact that macroeconomic policies and events can take around a year to affect the economy. 
- While more lags could be used, there was a risk of overfitting the model.

## Parsimonious Model: Specifications

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Unemployment rate and GDP change highly collinear: phillips curve
- **Break-even inflation rate:**
    + Bank of Canada estimates that 65% of consumers are backwards-looking while 35% of consumers are forwards-looking[^1]. 
    + Take difference in monthly conventional bond yields (CBY) and monthly real return bond yields (RBY) to measure consumer expectations.
    + RBY is inflation-protected, CBY is not. Difference gives us the *expected inflation rate*.

- Supply-side inflationary pressures: 
    + LFS-micro: measure of canadian wage growth
    + BCPI: measure of underlying price of raw materials

## Parsimonious Model: Measuring Tarrif Pressures

- In 2022, exports to the United States accounted for 17.8% of Canada's GDP and supported over 2.4 million jobs in Canada.
- Need a method of measuring the effect of Trump's tarrifs on the economy. 
    + **Exchange rate**: greater tarrifs &rarr; depreciation of canadian dollar &rarr; inflation, slower GDP growth.
- Issue: Exchange rate measures broad-based, currency-driven inflation
    + **Effective tarrif rate**: US Import charges / US customs value
    + Better measure of direct supply-side shocks

## Parsimonious Models: Inflation Prediction Results

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Both the GDP-based parsimonious model and the Unemployment Rate-based model predict roughly equivalent trends in YoY %-change CPI. 

- The inflation rate is expected to appreciate slowly over the course of 2025 and into 2026, going from 1.75% in July of 2025 to 3% in 2026. 

- The nature of a VAR-based model is high confidence intervals in predictions, so the results of the parsimonious models may be undershooting or overshooting the true inflation rate.

## Structural VARs: Measuring Potentional Effects of Trump's Tarrifs 

Given the uncertainty surrounding US politics and the US-Canadian trade war, it's important we forecast the potential shocks to inflation if the trade war were to escalate. 

- We apply a **Structural Vector Autoregressive Model:** we make assumptions about how the economy works contemporaneously, and apply those assumptions to our model. 
  + Done via Cholesky ordering: order variables from slowest-moving to fastest-moving.
